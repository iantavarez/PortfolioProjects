Hello! My name is Ian Tavarez, and I am a recent graduate from UC Santa Barbara with a degree in Economics and a passion for data. My fascination with numbers and statistics began in childhood, as I tracked basketball player averages. This early interest evolved into a love for data analysis and problem-solving through my studies in Economics. Courses in Econometrics and statistics sharpened my analytical skills and solidified my enthusiasm for data. Now, I am eager to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios and embark on a career in data analysis. In my free time, I enjoy playing chess and guitar, and I remain an avid NBA fan. I look forward to leveraging my skills and passion to contribute to innovative data-driven projects.

### NBA MVP Predictor (WIP)


Developed and implemented a machine learning model to predict the NBA MVP using Python and popular data science libraries (Pandas, Scikit-learn, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium). Collected, cleaned, and analyzed large datasets of player statistics, team performance, and historical MVP voting patterns to train and validate the model. Achieved an accuracy of 81.5% and gained insights into key factors influencing MVP selection, demonstrating strong analytical and predictive capabilities.
