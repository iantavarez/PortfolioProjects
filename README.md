Hello! My name is Ian Tavarez and I am a recent graduate from UC Santa Barbara with a degree in Economics and a passion for data! I've always been fascinated by numbers and statistics ever since I was a kid trying to memorize what basketball players averaged. My curiosity and studies in Economics helped develop my ability to think critically and solve problems. Taking Econometrics and other classes in the statistics department strengthened these skills and truly awakened my love for data.

### NBA MVP Predictor


Developed and implemented a machine learning model to predict the NBA MVP using Python and popular data science libraries (Pandas, Scikit-learn, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium). Collected, cleaned, and analyzed large datasets of player statistics, team performance, and historical MVP voting patterns to train and validate the model. Achieved an accuracy of 81.5% and gained insights into key factors influencing MVP selection, demonstrating strong analytical and predictive capabilities.
